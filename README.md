# Investigating the no show appointmnets dataset   

## By Mbang Ernest N.



## Introduction  

The dataset for this investigation is the No-show appointments dataset. **It is based on informataion collected from more than 100 thousand medical appointments in brasil** and based on gathering data on wether patients showed up for appointments or not. Several variables are used to capture the appropriate data to dissect the question on weather a patient will show up for appointments or not.  
##  Analysis interest
In our attempt to understand the insight of the data, we focused on just two questions that goes thus;

1. Does being an alcoholic influence ones likelihood of showing up for hospital appointments?
2. Do all those who receive SMSs show up for appointments? and is there any association between receiving an SMS and showing up for appointments?
